Designed to streamline your workflow, Deepr provides a simple and efficient way to store, organize, and launch deeplinks directly on your device.

Say goodbye to manually typing long URLs or searching through notes. With Deepr, you can focus on what matters: building and testing great apps.

**Features:**

*   **Save and Organize Deeplinks:** Easily store and manage a list of frequently used deeplinks.
*   **Launch Deeplinks:** Test and verify deeplink behavior by launching them directly from the app.
*   **Search:** Quickly find specific deeplinks from your saved list.

**Architecture:**

The application is built using modern Android development practices and libraries:

*   **UI:** The user interface is built entirely with **Jetpack Compose**, providing a modern and declarative approach to UI development.
*   **ViewModel:** **Android ViewModel** is used to manage UI-related data and handle the state of the application.
*   **Database:** **SQLDelight** is used for local data persistence, offering a lightweight and type-safe SQL database solution.
*   **Dependency Injection:** **Koin** is used for dependency injection to promote a modular and testable architecture.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** **Kotlin Coroutines** are used for managing background threads and handling asynchronous operations smoothly.
